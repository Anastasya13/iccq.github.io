# Code of Conduct # {#coc}

The open exchange of ideas and the freedom of thought and expression
are central to the aims and goals of ICCQ; these require an environment
that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group, that
fosters dignity, understanding, and mutual respect, and that embraces
diversity. For these reasons, ICCQ is dedicated to providing
a harassment-free conference experience, and abides by the
[ACM Policy Against Discrimination and Harassment at ACM Activities](https://www.acm.org/special-interest-groups/volunteer-resources/officers-manual/policy-against-discrimination-and-harassment).

Conference participants violating these standards may be sanctioned
or expelled from the conference, at the discretion of
the conference organizers. Conference organizers are requested
to report serious incidents to [abuse@iccq.ru](mailto:abuse@iccq.ru).
